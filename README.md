# Brief

This is the second version of AI flappy bird just to help me learn. This time
it's done in JavaScript using p5.js and tf.js.

I understand this is ugly, barely working and inefficient and that if I was to
read my code in a month I would get very confused. My goal was only to
learn the basics. I'll try harder in the next project.

All variables you might want to adjust are on top of the game.js file.

# Differences from the v1

The first version was coded (mainly) in C. This one is in JS (with p5). This
has major efficiency effects.

The second version runs in browser!

The second version has much better graphics, lol.

The second version uses a ML platform that was written by someone who knows
what he is doing (tensorflow.js).

The second version has adjustable speed.

And many more which I can't think of right now.

Huge thanks to Daniel Shiffman ("The Coding Train") for his online videos which
inspired this small project and helped when I was stuck.
